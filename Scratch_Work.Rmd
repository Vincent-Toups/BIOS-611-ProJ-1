```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
combine <- read.csv("source_data/combine.csv")
draft <- read.csv("source_data/draft.csv")
```

```{r}
head(combine)
str(combine)
summary(combine)
```

```{r}
head(draft)
str(draft)
summary(draft)
```


Initial cleaning
```{r}
#I'm thinking i'm going to use only data from 2000 on. I think these observations will be more complete. Also since the game has changed so much, this sort of analysis is only really relevant in the modern era of football. I also do not need a lot of these variables, lets select important ones 
Comb.2000 <- combine %>% 
  filter(combineYear >= 2000) %>% 
  select(1:6, 8:18, 28:33)
Draft.2000 <- draft %>% 
  filter(draft >= 2000) %>% 
  select(1:19)
  
#ok lets take out any rows with an NA just to see
Comb.compl <- na.omit(Comb.2000) 
Draft.compl <- na.omit(Draft.2000)[, c(1, 3, 4)]
```

Join and make final single csv

```{r}
#join
DF.clean <- na.omit(left_join(Comb.compl, Draft.compl, by = "playerId")[, -c(1, 3, 4:9, 11:13, 16)])

```
